Students will examine and analyze cases studies covering a broad range of business situations as well as other internal and external factors affecting and driving managerial decision-making. Students will work both individually and in groups, to present cases, and develop a foreign market-entry strategy project for a virtual company they will develop themselves.

Students will also be introduced to firms’ competitive behavior under asymmetry of information. Empirical models will mainly deal with complex problem of demand estimation in industries. Students will be provided with specific reference materials, but will be expected to read more advanced materials on some selected topics. Evaluations will be based on homeworks and exams, as well as they will be asked to read, analyze and present a seminal paper on IO and discuss it with their peers. This is a 3 credit hour course.",

Behavioral models usually have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics, and then consider a number of applications such as asset pricing (the aggregate stock market and the cross-section of average returns) or individual investor portfolio choice and trading behavior.",

To that end, we will enter the corridors of the United Nations and regional organizations in order to see how they deal with those crises in places such as Libya, Mali, Syria, Ukraine, Nagorno Karabakh, DRC or Colombia, and why, inter alia, criminal prosecution of masterminds of atrocity crimes in one place is not necessarily the right path to pursue in another.",

We will explore the theoretical foundations of foreign policy-making in both legal and political domains, followed by process-oriented analysis of foreign policy decision-making in select countries and how that affects the conduct of diplomacy. To that end, various decision-making models (rational state actor, bureaucratic/organizational, institutional, societal etc) will be discussed and assessed from the perspective of modern challenges contemporary states are facing – especially in the context of growing mass participation in politics and acceleration of news cycles. Naturally, we shall venture to understand the role of key players (government agencies, political parties, leaders, etc) and secondary participants (NGOs, private interest groups, corporations, etc) in the making of foreign policy, as well as their interactions in-between. To the extent possible, this course will be based on domestic political, legal and institutional factors, leaving external triggers in the background, since those are well discussed in other courses too, in order to have a clear focus and learning objectives.BREAKOne of the core assumptions the course is built on is that the precise model of decision-making process at play significantly impacts the particular course of action eventually chosen. The environment of foreign policy-making process – predominantly focusing on domestic political developments (in democratic, authoritarian and hybrid regimes) – will be assessed case-by-case, as well as in comparative perspective, to give a big-picture understanding of complex challenges modern states are struggling with in foreign policy making process.",

Built around interactive discussion sessions on the basis of assigned readings and independent research, we will discuss interactions between political institutions and the media, both in domestic politics and internationally. Some relevant issues pertaining to the role of media in functioning and fragile democracies, media and modern warfare, social networks and popular movements, elite media and political campaigning, “post-truth politics”, citizen journalism and other subjects will be deliberated with a view of helping students to understand how governments function in the age of media revolution. Certain notions, picked up from the case law of the European Court of Human rights (e.g. Perincek), the U.S. Supreme Court (Cohen v. California, Citizens United, etc) and ad hoc international tribunals (RTLM radio case, ICTR) will be reflected upon to improve student understanding of legal doctrine development and its effects on policies and politics. Instructor-led class may include lectures, discussions, case studies, readings, group work. Assessment may include class participation, papers, essays, exams, projects and presentations",

The course will address certain globalization aspects such as ‘push and pull’ as well as pluses and minuses, affecting states and populations. It will particularly deal with structure and processes of current dynamics in international affairs such as financial inequality, migration, statism vs. liberal structures, and will explore the current provocations created by populism and millennial socialism.  The course disciplines will include political economy and political science, exploring a number of international relations theories such as realism, liberalism, constructivism, structuralism and post-structuralism. Attention will be give to the special challenges of small states as they move forward with development strategies.  The course will include governing in a volatile global economy, particularly one embedded in current shocks affecting income, labor markets, law and normative behavior, migration and interdependence of global interactions such as trade and performance of transnational institutions.  The course will be conducted in a seminar format. This requires substantial discussion rather than lecture. Readings will prepare the participants for issues to be explored. The instructor will act as a discussion leader. The students will carry responsibility for proposing correlations and causations about which one can hypothesize. Students will report the significant ingredients of the readings and others will be prepared to react to issues presented and raise appropriate questions. One or two guest speakers will be invited to contribute to the seminar.  Course evaluation will include short concept papers; continued oral presentations and contributions; final term paper ability to analyze and critique other student presentations.",

Moreover, many of the languages occurring in these regions are spoken by small numbers of people indicating that much of the linguistic diversity (and, by implication, cultural diversity) currently present in biodiversity regions is in danger of disappearing in the foreseeable future due to the high vulnerability of small groups to changes in their cultural systems and environments amid rapid globalization.” From: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~romaine/lingbiodiversity.html.

Regardless of the choice of project, students document their work in the form of written reports and oral presentations.",
