The course is effectively split into two parts (math and stats followed by python and excel) and the second part is conducted in the labs.\nPrerequisites: None.\nNote:MBA students can use their “Data Analysis for Business Decisions” course to wave the 2 credit component of MGMT 300 devoted to statistics and probabilitytheory. It will suffice for them to participate in 2 credit component dedicated to introduction of Python.\nFall Semester\nMGMT 325 Business Analytics (Credits: 3)\nThis course will introduce the main concepts in business analytics, which will allow achieving fluency in four paradigms that account for most business decisions: marketing, operations, human resources and financial analytics. Students will learn how to build and evaluate supervised learning models and how to incorporate the results in the decision making process. Regression and classification tasks are the core of the course. Students also explore the common pitfalls in interpreting statistical arguments, especially those associated with big data. In the final Project, students will apply their skills to interpret a real-world data set and make appropriate business strategy recommendations. Instructor led classes are combined with dedicated lab sessions.\nPrerequisite: MGMT 300\nMGMT 329 Data Management (Credits: 3)\nThe purpose of this course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of data management principles and techniques essential for effective analysis. The course covers various aspects, including data manipulation, scraping, SQL, and visualization.
