Industrial economies have primarily operated \nunder a linear model of \"take-make-waste,\" where resources are \nextracted to make products that eventually end up as waste and \nremoved from the material and energy flows of the economy. This \napproach has had severe environmental consequences for our \nplanet. Over the past few decades, there is greater emphasis on \ntransitioning to a system where material and energy flows are \nincreasingly circular. This system of circular economy is based on \nthree principles: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products \nand materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. What \nare the choices and strategies by suppliers, designers, businesses, \npolicymakers and all of us as consumers that will help transition to \na circular, regenerative economy? The course focuses on \naddressing this question. The course also offers tools to analyze \ncircular business models.\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nI\nA\n\nBSESS Curriculum Map\nUpdated Aug. 2024\nafter S ESS 240 Sustainable \nCities\n3\nESS 101\nThe course will introduce the concept of sustainable cities—places \nwhere there is human prosperity, social equity, and environmental \nhealth.
